# SplashStats

[SplashStats](https://alex-j-miller.github.io/SplashStats/) is a specialized full-stack application developed for the [Calvin Swimming and Diving](https://calvinknights.com/sports/mens-swimming-and-diving) team. Built with React on the frontend and Node.js on the backend, it streamlines the process of viewing and gathering swimming times from [SwimCloud.com](https://www.swimcloud.com/team/55/). Designed with the needs of the team's coaches in mind, SplashStats allows easy access to performance data and offers the functionality to download this data as CSV files, significantly reducing the time and effort required for this task. This tool was created to eliminate the repetitive and tedious nature of data collection, providing coaches with a more efficient way to manage their team's statistics.
